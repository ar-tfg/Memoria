In the last decade augmented reality has become an accessible technology to millions of users through their smartphones. Initially based on the use of markers, today there are algorithms capable of using it without markers, despite the success of games like Pokemon Go, this technology has not yet been consolidated.\\

This thesis presents an analysis of the possibilities of augmented reality, focused on markerless AR. Throughout the project, existing libraries are explored and studied, in order to discover their similarities and differences by developing small proofs of concept.\\ 

With the results obtained from this study, three applications will be developed. These applications will try to leverage all the potential of the libraries and the technologies studied. The first application helps the user in the furniture assembling process showing it step by step, using ARCore and its markerless functionalities.In order to show the augmented reality possibilities in videogames, a multiplayer videogame is developed using cloud anchors and plane detection.
Finally, the last application allows us to interact with the environment in a more natural way using Aryzon\footnote{Cardboard glasses that allow us to have an augmented reality experience.\cite{Aryzon}} glasses interacting with the objects placed in the chosen plane.
